Things that I have learnt from this project:

-Using modules to have closures in my code

-looping through an array to use document query selector without repeating myself.

-misplacing defer in html doc can lead to serious problems
		When in doubt.. Code pen it out.
	
-learnt how to contain variables and functions in methods
  
-Learnt that I still need to figure out how to be less repetitive with if else functions
	
-can still use some work in creating more functions within a methods scope to make my code cleaner. Maybe during a refactor I can try to apply this concept.

-finally learnt how to properly incorporate a refresh button instead of just refreshing the page like Iâ€™ve done on past projects (etch a sketch)
	
-really started to grasp the concept of looping through node lists, allowing me to use getElementsByClassName effectively.
	
-when struggling with implementing my computer player, I had to move a lot of code around. I learnt the importance of needing to organize code logically and how planning in advance can be beneficial.
